# waveframe-v3.1

Refined entropy-based cosmology model. Successor to v3.0. Stricter license, sharpened formulations, enhanced horizon dynamics, and a foundation for information-first geometry. No scalar fields.

---

## Overview

Waveframe 3.1 is a refined cosmological model rooted in informational entropy, offering an alternative to scalar-field or potential-based dark energy frameworks. It advances the entropic geometry introduced in v3.0 with more coherent formalism, cleaner derivations, and a strictly enforced license to protect intellectual continuity.

This model treats spacetime as emergent — a holographic projection derived from entropy gradients — and interprets cosmic expansion as a thermodynamic process, not a fundamental force. Built openly, documented clearly, and derived from first principles using symbolic modeling and iterative formulation.

This is the official continuation of Waveframe v3.0, now frozen and archived under the MIT license. All future development will extend from this version.

## What’s New in v3.1

- Adopted Apache 2.0 License for stricter attribution and legal clarity  
- Enhanced the H(z) expansion law with improved entropy-gradient derivation  
- Refined the entropy-horizon relation:  
S(t) = π ⁄ H(t)²  
- Introduced a foundation for information-first geometry in future versions  
- Reorganized repository for improved reproducibility and clarity

## Core Hypothesis

- Spacetime is not fundamental; it emerges from an underlying informational substrate.  
- Cosmic expansion arises from horizon entropy growth, not scalar field dynamics.  
- Entropy gradients define the arrow of time and determine the observable metric.  
- Geometry evolves from informational constraints imposed by causal boundaries.

## Mathematical Foundations

- Horizon entropy:  
  S(t) = π ⁄ H(t)²

- Entropy growth law:  
  dS⁄dt = γ(z)  
  ⇒ Ḣ = −[γ(z) · H³] ⁄ 2π

- Comoving distance:  
  d_C(z) = ∫₀ᶻ [c ⁄ H(z′)] dz′

- Luminosity distance:  
  d_L(z) = (1 + z) · d_C(z)

These relations define the expansion dynamics, geometric structure, and observational behavior of the model.

## Methodology and Attribution

This project was developed through intense iteration using open-source tools, real observational data, and large language models for assistance with research, mathematics, and code. This work is the product of human oversight and synthesis using AI as a cognitive amplifier, not a generative source.

All derivations, interpretations, and formulations are reviewed, validated, and documented for reproducibility and theoretical coherence.

Waveframe v3.1 is not intended as a final theory. It is an open proposal — a philosophical and mathematical challenge to dominant cosmological models. You are welcome to study it, test it, critique it, or build upon it.
