## Hubble-Entropy Relation in Entropic Cosmology

In the Waveframe framework, a central assumption is that entropy — not energy density — governs the expansion of the universe. Specifically, we postulate a functional relationship between the Hubble parameter \( H(t) \) and the total entropy enclosed within the cosmological horizon. This section formalizes that relationship.

## 1. Horizon Entropy Definition

We define the total entropy \( S(t) \) at cosmic time \( t \) in terms of the horizon area, following a holographic prescription:

\[
S(t) = \frac{\pi}{H(t)^2}
\]

This assumes natural units (\( G = \hbar = c = k_B = 1 \)) and a flat geometry. The entropy is taken to be proportional to the area of the apparent horizon in Planck units.

## 2. Inverting the Relationship

Solving the entropy relation for \( H(t) \):

\[
H(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{S(t)}}
\]

This is the core principle that reverses the traditional direction of cosmological reasoning. Instead of deriving entropy from geometry, we derive geometry from entropy.

## 3. Differential Formulation

To derive evolution equations, we compute the time derivative of \( H(t) \):

\[
\dot{H}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{S(t)^3}} \cdot \dot{S}(t)
\]

This expresses the rate of change of cosmic expansion directly in terms of the entropy production rate.

---

## 4. Constraint on Entropy Evolution

Since \( H(t) > 0 \) in an expanding universe, \( S(t) \) must be increasing for \( \dot{H}(t) < 0 \). Thus, accelerated expansion corresponds to a decreasing entropy production rate, while deceleration follows from an increasing one.

---

## 5. Summary

The Hubble-entropy relation:

\[
H(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{S(t)}}
\]

is not just an identity — it’s a guiding principle for reformulating cosmological evolution as an information-theoretic process. From this basis, the Waveframe model derives expansion dynamics, time evolution, and emergent geometry.
