# 01 · Modified Expansion Law from Entropic Constraints

## Overview

In this section, we derive the specific form of the cosmic expansion law that emerges naturally from entropic principles. Rather than postulating a Friedmann equation with matter or scalar fields, we let entropy growth guide the evolution of the Hubble parameter \( H(t) \).

## 1. Entropic Assumption

From the prior formulation, we assume that the horizon entropy \( S(t) \) is given by:

\[
S(t) = rac{π}{H(t)^2}
\]

Taking the time derivative:

\[
rac{dS}{dt} = -rac{2π}{H(t)^3} \cdot rac{dH}{dt}
\]

This implies:

\[
rac{dH}{dt} = -rac{H(t)^3}{2π} \cdot rac{dS}{dt}
\]

If entropy increases linearly:

\[
S(t) = κ (t - t₀)
\]

Then:

\[
rac{dS}{dt} = κ = 	ext{const.}
\]

Substitute into the previous equation:

\[
rac{dH}{dt} = -rac{κ H(t)^3}{2π}
\]

This is a separable differential equation in \( H(t) \):

\[
rac{dH}{H^3} = -rac{κ}{2π} dt
\]

## 2. Solution to the Expansion Law

Integrating both sides:

\[
\int rac{dH}{H^3} = -rac{κ}{2π} \int dt
\]

\[
-rac{1}{2 H(t)^2} = -rac{κ}{2π}(t - t₀) + C
\]

Solving for \( H(t) \):

\[
H(t)^2 = rac{1}{κ'(t - t₀) + C'}
\]

Assuming the constants normalize such that \( C' = 0 \) and \( κ' = 	ext{const.} \), we find:

\[
H(t) ∝ rac{1}{\sqrt{t - t₀}}
\]

This modified expansion law replaces energy density evolution with a law derived from the informational structure of the universe.

## 3. Comparison to ΛCDM Expansion

In standard cosmology, expansion is governed by:

\[
H(t)^2 = rac{8πG}{3}ρ(t)
\]

Where \( ρ(t) \) is the total energy density. In our entropic model:

- The role of \( ρ(t) \) is replaced by the entropy slope \( dS/dt \)
- The expansion rate follows a decay law unrelated to matter content
- Late-time behavior predicts a slow-roll decline without a constant de Sitter limit

## 4. Implications

This expansion law:
- Implies continuous entropy production
- Disallows asymptotic de Sitter acceleration
- Reframes cosmological “acceleration” as a shift in the rendering rate of spacetime geometry

It also predicts a horizon that grows sublinearly:

\[
R_H(t) ∝ \sqrt{t - t₀}
\]

Which implies an evolving causal domain and information-access horizon consistent with an expanding but decelerating spacetime.

## Summary

We derive a modified expansion law from the assumption of monotonic entropy growth. This provides a foundational dynamic for Waveframe cosmology that is purely informational, not energetic, and aligns with observational signatures of non-Λ dark energy evolution.
