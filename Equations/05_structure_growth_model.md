# 05 – Structure Growth Model

## Overview

Waveframe v3.1 introduces a novel structure growth framework grounded in entropy-driven expansion rather than scalar-field dynamics or pressure-based matter fluids. This section outlines how structure growth emerges from the entropic geometry, emphasizing horizon evolution and redshift-dependent entropy gradients as the underlying drivers.

## Approach

Unlike ΛCDM, which models growth via density perturbations in a matter-dominated fluid, Waveframe treats growth as a response to informational constraints tightening within causal boundaries. As H(t) evolves according to entropy flow, it indirectly governs the growth rate of inhomogeneities via the effective gravitational potential shaped by emergent geometry.

The redshift-dependent entropy term \( \gamma(z) \) indirectly shapes both expansion and structure growth. Although no field equations are used, we can define an effective growth factor:

\[
f(z) = \frac{d \ln D(z)}{d \ln a}
\]

Where:

- \( D(z) \) is the growth function
- \( a \) is the scale factor \( a = \frac{1}{1 + z} \)

In Waveframe, \( D(z) \) evolves from entropy-constrained metrics and numerical solutions of the background expansion law:

\[
\dot{H} = -\frac{\gamma(z) H^3}{2\pi}
\]

This sets the backbone for a derived \( f\sigma_8(z) \) curve, which can be tested against RSD data.

## Observational Status

The current implementation approximates structure growth by:

- Numerically integrating \( H(z) \)
- Constructing \( D(z) \) via background evolution
- Computing \( f(z) \) from logarithmic derivatives
- Scaling by an assumed \( \sigma_8 \) normalization at \( z = 0 \)

While not fully rigorous, this approach gives a first-order check on whether entropy-based models can reproduce RSD data trends. So far, results show rough agreement in shape, with minor deviations at higher z — attributed to lack of direct clustering physics.

## Path Forward

To refine this growth model:

- Introduce a more explicit mapping from entropy gradient to gravitational binding conditions
- Calibrate \( \gamma(z) \) against actual \( f\sigma_8 \) data, not just H(z)
- Extend the numerical solution to handle perturbation-like quantities derived from entropy evolution
- Optionally introduce effective metrics to bridge to standard perturbation theory

Waveframe’s structure growth logic diverges from traditional models not in defiance, but in intention: it seeks to replace underlying assumptions, not replicate them. Precision comparison with data is forthcoming in v3.2 and Waveframe XR.
