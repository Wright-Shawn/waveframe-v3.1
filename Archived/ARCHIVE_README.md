# Archived Files â€“ Waveframe v3.1

This folder contains legacy files from earlier development stages of the Waveframe v3.1 project. These materials were used for internal experimentation, model fitting, and data validation but are **not** actively maintained or required for core functionality.

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose of Archival
These files are preserved for historical reference and transparency. They reflect:
- Early modeling approaches
- Jupyter/Colab-based simulation attempts
- Placeholder or test data files
- Prototypes and redundant files not integrated into final modules

## ðŸ”¹ Archived Files

| Filename                         | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Waveframe_Fits.ipynb`          | Jupyter notebook for model fit testing (early-stage)         |
| `PantheonPlus_SN_binned.csv`    | Observational SN data (used in residual comparison)          |
| `notebook_development_notes.md` | Notes related to early notebook experimentation              |

## ðŸ”¹ Why Not Used Now
- Core computations and plots have been ported to script or markdown format for portability.
- Colab runtime issues and mobile UI limitations made notebooks impractical.
- Project now prioritizes direct reproducibility via repo scripts and `.md` documentation.

## ðŸ”¹ Retention Policy
These files will remain in `Archived/` permanently but will **not** be referenced by current theory or equation logic. They are **not deprecated**, but rather decoupled from the mainline repo structure.
