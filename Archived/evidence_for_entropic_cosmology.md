# Evidence for Entropic Cosmology

This file summarizes peer-reviewed support for core claims underlying the Waveframe v3.1 model. While speculative in its full form, several foundational elements are backed by existing literature in theoretical cosmology and quantum gravity.

## 1. Spacetime as Emergent from Entropy or Information

Multiple independent studies support the notion that spacetime is not fundamental, but instead emerges from deeper entropic or information-theoretic principles:

- Ilgin, E. (2019). "Emergence of Spacetime and Entanglement."
- Matsueda, H. (2014). "Geometry and Entropy in AdS/CFT."
- Rosenhaus, V. (2014). "Entanglement Entropy and Emergent Geometry."
- Padmanabhan, T., & Paranjape, A. (2006). "Entropy of Null Surfaces and Dynamics of Spacetime."

## 2. Cosmic Expansion Linked to Entropy Rather than Scalar Fields

Entropic gravity models argue that cosmic expansion may result from information-theoretic effects rather than scalar fields, challenging the standard ΛCDM framework:

- Verlinde, E. (2016). "Emergent Gravity and the Dark Universe."
- Moradpour, H. (2016). "Thermodynamic Interpretation of the Emergent Gravity."
- Farahmand, F., & Mohammadzadeh, H. (2017). "A Thermodynamic Approach to Cosmic Acceleration."

## 3. Entropy Gradients Define Time and Cosmological Behavior

The arrow of time and evolution of the universe may arise from entropy gradients rather than being fundamental aspects of spacetime:

- Sharma, A. (2025). "Chronoentropy: Time from Thermodynamics in a Gravitational Background."
- Alshal, T. (2023). "Entropy-Based Derivations of Einstein’s Field Equations in Modified Gravity."

## 4. Reformulating Cosmological Observables from Entropic Laws

Attempts have been made to derive the Hubble parameter and distance measures directly from entropy-based principles. These are speculative but align conceptually with the Waveframe framework:

- Matsueda, H. (2014). "Entropic Geometry and RG Flow."
- Kothawala, D., & Padmanabhan, T. (2014). "Thermodynamic Structure of Spacetime from Horizon Entropy."

## Summary

Waveframe v3.1 builds on these theoretical precedents by proposing a direct entropic definition of the Hubble parameter and cosmic evolution. While unconventional, the framework is partially grounded in peer-reviewed models and contributes to the broader investigation into emergent cosmology.
