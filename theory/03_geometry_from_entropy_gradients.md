# 03. Geometry from Entropy Gradients

In Waveframe, the geometry of spacetime is not fundamental. Instead, it is proposed to emerge from entropy gradients across cosmic horizons. This reorients the traditional view of spacetime as a fixed backdrop and replaces it with a dynamic informational manifold.

## Entropy and Metric Structure

The relation

    S(t) = π ⁄ H(t)²

connects the entropy of the cosmic horizon to the expansion rate. Since entropy increases with time due to causal decoherence, the Hubble parameter H(t) decreases over time, shaping how distances and scales evolve.

This entropy-centric formulation naturally yields time-dependent metrics, where curvature and scale are byproducts of entropic flow. The geometry is therefore encoded not in curvature tensors but in the informational content defined by a horizon’s entropy area.

## Functional View of Geometry

Rather than a rigid Riemannian space, Waveframe treats geometry as a function of horizon dynamics:

    g_{μν}(t) ∝ f[S(t)]

where the metric g_{μν} is inferred from the entropy dynamics instead of being postulated a priori.

This approach gives rise to a causal structure that reflects the information content of the universe, not just the local energy-momentum distribution.

## Implications

- Gravitational dynamics may be emergent rather than fundamental.
- Geometry becomes an effect of the entropic encoding of causal structure.
- Observable spacetime inherits its shape and scale from the holographic boundary conditions imposed by horizon entropy.

This paradigm invites reinterpretation of classical results like the Friedmann equations, which in Waveframe are derived from entropy flow rather than energy conservation in a fluid.
