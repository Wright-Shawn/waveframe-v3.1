# 05 Prior Work Comparison

## Overview

Waveframe v3.1 builds upon and diverges from prior attempts to relate thermodynamics, gravity, and cosmological expansion. While its conceptual lineage includes works by Jacobson, Padmanabhan, and Verlinde, this model advances several distinct contributions that justify its status as a novel framework.

## Theoretical Lineage and Points of Departure

### Jacobson (1995)

- Jacobson derived Einstein’s field equations from the thermodynamic relation:

  ΔQ = TΔS ⇒ G_{μν} ∝ T_{μν}

- Waveframe breaks with this approach by **not** attempting to recover Einstein’s equations, but instead replacing them with a direct thermodynamic law of expansion:

  Ḣ = −(γ(z) · H³) ⁄ 2π

- **Difference:** Jacobson’s framework is thermodynamic but still grounded in general relativity. Waveframe proposes entropy as primary, *not* emergent from GR.

---

### Verlinde (2011)

- Verlinde’s entropic gravity interprets gravity as an emergent force due to changes in entropy across holographic screens.

- Waveframe parallels this in philosophy but applies it to the **cosmic horizon** rather than localized systems.

- **Key Distinction:** Verlinde’s formulation leads to Newtonian gravity and modifications of MOND. Waveframe directly derives the **cosmological expansion rate** from entropy laws, not gravitational dynamics.

---

### Padmanabhan (2010–2022)

- Padmanabhan proposed that the expansion of space is driven by a difference in degrees of freedom between bulk and boundary:

  ΔV ∝ (N_{sur} − N_{bulk})

- Waveframe similarly considers the causal horizon’s entropy, but does not count discrete degrees of freedom. Instead, it uses:

  S(t) = π ⁄ H(t)²

  and evolves H(t) from entropy production constraints:

  dS ⁄ dt = γ(z)

- **Difference:** Padmanabhan’s model is still semi-classical and retains elements of GR. Waveframe treats entropy as **fundamental**, with geometry as emergent.

## Novel Contributions of Waveframe v3.1

1. **No dependence on Einstein field equations, scalar fields, or modified gravity.**

2. **A single differential equation (Ḣ) governs expansion, derived purely from entropy principles.**

3. **Structure growth included via fσ₈(z), enabling comparisons with data.**

4. **Reproducible and documented from scratch — no prior assumptions from inflation or dark energy.**

5. **Falsifiability built in through direct observational constraints on γ(z).**

Waveframe is an original synthesis of entropy-based expansion, reframed to be testable, falsifiable, and transparent.
