# 02 – Emergent Time and Causal Structure

Waveframe posits that time is not fundamental but emerges from the differential evolution of entropy across causal boundaries. In this view, the arrow of time is inseparable from thermodynamic asymmetry, and cosmic history unfolds not as a clock-driven progression, but as a consequence of expanding informational horizons.

## Time from Entropy

Unlike Newtonian mechanics or general relativity, which assume a continuous temporal manifold, Waveframe defines time operationally: as the growth parameter of entropy across the horizon area.

Let:

S(t) = π / H(t)²

Then, the rate of entropy change defines an effective clock:

dS/dt = γ(z)

Inverting this, one may reconstruct an emergent time coordinate from observational data, e.g., redshift or horizon radius. This yields a “time” that reflects causal ordering rather than absolute simultaneity.

## Causal Structure

Causality in Waveframe is linked to the informational accessibility of regions bounded by horizons. A causal boundary is defined not by null geodesics but by the rate at which entropy can be transferred or resolved.

The causal structure emerges from:

- Entropic gradients across the horizon
- Rate of information integration into the observable region
- Expansion of accessible Hilbert space

In this picture, causal disconnection is not due to light cones per se, but due to insufficient entropy resolution. The universe appears fragmented not because of distance, but because the informational cost of stitching distant regions exceeds what is entropically permitted.

## Summary

- Time is not fundamental; it emerges from entropy flow.
- Causality is determined by informational accessibility.
- Horizon area growth substitutes for clock-based cosmology.

This reformulation permits models where geometry is secondary, and where the sequence of cosmic events reflects thermodynamic necessity rather than geometric determinism.
