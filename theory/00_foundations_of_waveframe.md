# Foundations of the Waveframe Cosmology

Waveframe is a conceptual cosmology model grounded in the assumption that spacetime and geometry are not fundamental, but emergent. Its core framework reinterprets expansion as a thermodynamic process arising from horizon entropy, rather than a dynamical effect caused by exotic energy fields or curvature alone.

## 1. Core Premises

- **Informational Substrate:** The universe is encoded in an underlying information structure. Geometry arises from this data, not vice versa.

- **Entropy as Driver:** The expansion rate is not arbitrary; it follows from the rate of horizon entropy growth.

- **Horizon Definition:** Horizons are thermodynamic boundaries, not geometric shells. They mark the informational boundary of what can be known and influence the observed structure of reality.

## 2. Ontological View

In contrast to classical general relativity or scalar-field quintessence models, Waveframe posits that space is a projection—similar to a hologram—from an evolving entropy field. What expands is not “space” but the resolution of observable reality as more information is rendered.

Perceived expansion is not balloon-like. Instead, it behaves like a clarity gradient: things do not move away from us, they become *more* distinct as entropy gradients sharpen.

## 3. Expansion Law (Minimal Math)

Let H(t) denote the Hubble parameter. The entropy of a causal horizon is given by

  S(t) = π ⁄ H(t)²

Then the entropy growth implies:

  Ḣ = −[γ(z) · H(t)³] ⁄ 2π

where γ(z) encodes the effective entropy gradient with redshift.

## 4. Departure from ΛCDM

- No cosmological constant (Λ) is required.
- No scalar field is introduced to mimic dark energy.
- Geometry is not taken as a given; it is an emergent result.
- Observational predictions arise from thermodynamic principles, not field dynamics.

## 5. Interpretive Implications

Waveframe is not merely an alternative cosmological solution—it redefines the *question* itself. Rather than asking how the universe evolves *in* space, we ask how space arises from evolving information. The metric is a reflection, not a scaffold.

This foundational perspective shapes all subsequent derivations, including the entropy-redshift relation, observational distances, and structure formation under entropic rendering.
